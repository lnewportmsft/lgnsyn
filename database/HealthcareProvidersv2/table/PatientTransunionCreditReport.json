Credit scoring is a method of determining the likelihood that credit users will pay their bills. Fair, Isaac began its pioneering work with credit scoring in the late 1950s and, since then, scoring has become widely accepted by lenders as a reliable means of credit evaluation. \n\nA credit score attempts to condense a borrowers credit history into a single number. Fair, Isaac & Co. and the credit bureaus do not reveal how these scores are computed. The Federal Trade Commission has ruled this to be acceptable.\n\nCredit scores are calculated by using scoring models and mathematical tables that assign points for different pieces of information which best predict future credit performance. Developing these models involves studying how thousands, even millions, of people have used credit. Score-model developers find predictive factors in the data that have proven to indicate future credit performance. Models can be developed from different sources of data. Credit-bureau models are developed from information in consumer credit-bureau reports. \n\nCredit scores analyze a borrower's credit history considering numerous factors such as:\n\nLate payments \nThe amount of time credit has been established \nThe amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available \nLength of time at present residence \nEmployment history \nNegative credit information such as bankruptcies, charge-offs, collections, etc. \n\nThere are really three FICO scores computed by data provided by each of the three bureaus: Experian, Trans Union and Equifax. \n\nSome lenders use one of these three scores, while other lenders may use the middle score.\n\nTRW/FICO Model: This scoring system developed by TRW in association with Fair, Isaac, and Company, Inc. The score enables credit grantor to identify credit prospect with the best credit opportunities and avoid losses due to charge-offs, repossessions, collections, and bankruptcies.\n\nBeacon: This scoring system developed by Equifax in association with Fair, Isaac, and Company, Inc. Beacon helps identifies and projects the full range of serious consumer credit risks which include bankruptcies, charge-offs, repossessions, loan defaults, and serious delinquencies.\n\nEmpirica: This scoring system developed by Trans Union in association with Fair, Isaac, and Company, Inc.
